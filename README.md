# This is just me dabbling with LWJGL based on ThinMatrix.

# The plan is to make a 3D version of the board game: Tobago.
# However, to make the game interactive and real-time, I've had to change a number of things.
# Those familiar with the board game should recognize the general concept: "Clue" in reverse.
#
# The idea is that you are a treasure hunter on an island. There are a number of riches to be found,
# but - you're not the only one looking for them, and you don't have all the clues to locate the 
# treasures just yet. As you navigate your land rover over the various terrains, you will encounter
# chests which contain clues to where one of four treasures are located. Your opponents will also
# be searching for these clues. Once enough clues have been found, the treasure will be revealed and
# the first person to reach it can claim it as their own!
