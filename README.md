This is just me dabbling with LWJGL (Light Weight Java Game Library) based on ThinMatrix.

The plan is to make a 3D version of the board game: Tobago [https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42215/tobago]
However, to make the game interactive and real-time, I've had to change a number of things. Those familiar with the board game should recognize the general concept: "Clue" in reverse.

## Concept
The idea is that you are a treasure hunter on an island. There are a number of riches to be found, but - you're not the only one looking for them, and you don't have all the clues to locate the treasures just yet. As you navigate your Land Rover over the various terrains, you will encounter chests which contain clues, "power-ups" and curses. The clues will narrow down the location to where one of four treasures are located. Your opponents will also be searching for these clues. Once enough clues have been found, the treasure will be revealed and the first person to reach it can claim it as their own!

## Play Details:
Along the way the player will encounter a rich environment full of five major areas: forests, plains, beaches, lakes and mountains. The treasure could be in any of these areas! To narrow it down, you must rely on your clues. For example, the WHITE treausre may be within the largest mountain range, within 3 kilometers of a native hut, and within 2 kilometers of a lake. Once you've narrowed it down to a single location, the treasure will appear on the map and then the first player to reach it can claim it! To help you out (or to hurt you) there are some ancient island idols. These mysterious ancient masters can deposit medalions to protect you from curses, but watch out! - if you get in their way, you could take some SERIOUS damage! Drive your Land Rover across the country looking for clues in shipping crates. Sometimes they will be empty, sometimes they will contain power ups like extra gas, turbo chargers, big tires for beach movement, special gear to become sea worthy for lake travel, etc.; but, sometimes they will also contain curses.
